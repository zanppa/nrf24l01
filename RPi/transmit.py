# Example program to communicate with TI Tiva Launchpad
# with Nordic nRF24L01 radio module, using ACK payloads.
#
# This is the transmitter running on Raspberry Pi Zero W.
# This program sends periodically a PINGxx message, where
# xx is a hex going from 0 to FF.
#
# Tiva replies with PONGyy, where yy is the previous received
# number. Both sent and received messages are printed on the
# screen as well as possible transmit errors.
